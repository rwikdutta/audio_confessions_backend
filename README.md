# Audio Confessions and Q and A App Backend
## Introduction
This app was developed for the students of my college to post anonymized (via voice masking and profile masking) audio confessions and also ask questions ( in text ) to any other user of this platform. The backend was developed using the Django Framework in Python and the frontend was in Android.

N.B. : Please note that right now there's a few temporary hacks in place which will be updated soon. So please bear with me till then since right now I dont have time to make those changes.

## Endpoints of the app
Will be updated soon....

## About the frontend
